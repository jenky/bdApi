# API Documents

## Authorization
The system follows OAuth2 specification [IETF draft v10](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-10).

### Supported scopes
 * `read`
 * `post`
 * `usercp`
 * `conversate`
 * `admincp`

### Supported grant types
 * Authorization code
 * User credentials (username / password)
 * Refresh token

### One Time Token
Any client can generate one time token (OTT) using existing token. The format for OTT is as follow:

    user_id,timestamp,once,client_id

With `user_id` is the ID of authenticated user; `timestamp` is the unix timestamp for OTT expire time, the OTT will work as long as indicated by `timestamp` or by token expire date, whatever comes first; `client_id` is the client ID; `once` is md5 of a concentration of `user_id`, `timestamp`, a valid existing token and the client secret. Example code to generate an OTT:

    <?php

    $timestamp = time() + $ttl;
    $once = md5($userId . $timestamp . $accessToken . $clientSecret);

    $ott = sprintf('%d,%d,%s,%s', $userId, $timestamp, $once, $clientId);

### Configuration
 * TTL of access token: 1 hour
 * TTL of authorization code: 30 seconds
 * TTL of refresh token: 2 weeks
 * Authorization URI: `/oauth/authorize`
 * Access token exchange URI: `/oauth/token`

Please note that the TTL can be reconfigured to make it expire sooner or much later.

### Social Logins
Since oauth2-2015030602, social logins are accepted as a way to authorize access to an user account. List of supported services: Facebook, Twitter and Google. The common flow is:

 1. Third party client authorize user via social service (e.g. awesomewebsite.com use Facebook Application A to authorize user).
 2. Third party client obtains access token to social service (e.g. awesomewebsite.com has Facebook access token T).
 3. Third party client submits access token to API endpoint to request access token to XenForo (e.g. awesomewebsite.com sends Facebook access token T to xenforo.com).
 4. XenForo verifies that access token is valid and third party client does have access to a XenForo account (e.g. xenforo.com contacts Facebook server to verify access token T then cross-matches to a XenForo user account U).
 5. XenForo generates API access token for its account (e.g. xenforo.com generates access token T2 which can be used in future API requests).

It's important to note that third party client and XenForo systems don't need to use the same social service credentials (e.g. awesomewebsite.com use Facebook Application A while xenforo.com can use Facebook Application B).

#### Responses
If an API access token can be generated, the response is similar to a regular POST `/oauth/token` with token and refresh_token amongst other things. Previously user-granted scopes and auto-authorized scopes will be attached to the token.

Otherwise, the API will try to response with as much information for a new user account as possible. The data is ready to be used with POST `/users`.

#### POST `/oauth/token/facebook`
Request API access token using Facebook access token. Because Facebook uses app-scoped user_id, it is not possible to recognize user across different Facebook Applications using any unique ID. Therefore email is used to find registered user.

Parameters:

 * `client_id` (__required__)
 * `client_secret` (__required__)
 * `facebook_token` (__required__)

Required scopes:

 * N/A

#### POST `/oauth/token/twitter`
Request API access token using Twitter access token.

Parameters:

 * `client_id` (__required__)
 * `client_secret` (__required__)
 * `twitter_uri` (__required__): the full `/account/verify_credentials.json` uri that has been used to calculate OAuth signature.
 * `twitter_auth` (__required__): the complete authentication header that starts with "OAuth". Consult [Twitter document](https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/creating-signatures) for more information.

Required scopes:

 * N/A

#### POST `/oauth/token/google`
Request API access token using Google access token.

Parameters:

 * `client_id` (__required__)
 * `client_secret` (__required__)
 * `google_token` (__required__)

Required scopes:

 * N/A

#### POST `/oauth/token/admin`
Request API access token for another user. This requires `admincp` scope and the current user must have sufficient system permissions. Since oauth2-2015030902.

Parameters:

 * `user_id` (__required__): id of the user that needs access token.

Required scopes:

 * `admincp`

## Discoverability
System information and availability can be determined by sending a GET request to `/` (index route). A list of resources will be returned. If the request is authenticated, the revisions of API system and installed modules will also made available for further inspection.

## Common Parameters

### Fields filtering
For API method with resource data like a forum or a thread, the data can be filtered to get interested fields only. When there are no filter 

 * `fields_include`: coma-separated list of fields of a resource. If this parameter is used along with `fields_exclude`, the other parameter will be ignored.
 * `fields_exclude`: coma-separated list of fields of a resource to exclude in the response. Cannot be used with `fields_include` or this parameter will be ignored.

### Resource ordering
For API method with list of resources, the resources can be ordered differently with the parameter `order`. List of supported orders will be specified for each method. The default order will always be `natural`. Most of the time, the natural order is the order of which each resource is added to the system (resource id for example).

### Encryption
For sensitive information like password, encryption can be used to increase data security. For all encryption with key support, the `client_secret` will be used as the key. List of supported encryptions:

 * `aes128`: AES 128 bit encryption (mode: ECB, padding: PKCS#7). Because of algorithm limitation, the binary md5 hash of key will be used instead of the key itself.

List of supported topics:

 * `user_x` (x is the user_id of the interested user): receives ping when user data is inserted, updated or deleted. The registered callback will be included in GET `/users/:userId` as parameter `subscription_callback`.
 * `user_notification_x` (x is the user_id of the interested user): receives ping when user gets a new notification. Notification data will be included in the ping. The registered callback will be included in GET `/notifications` as parameter `subscription_callback`.
 * `thread_post_x` (x is the thread_id of the interested thread): receives ping when a post in the thread is inserted, updated or deleted. The registered callback will be included in GET `/posts?thread_id=x` as parameter `subscription_callback`.
