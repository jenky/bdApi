# API Documents

## Authorization
The system follows OAuth2 specification [IETF draft v10](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-10).

### Supported scopes
 * `read`
 * `post`
 * `usercp`
 * `conversate`
 * `admincp`

### Supported grant types
 * Authorization code
 * User credentials (username / password)
 * Refresh token

### One Time Token
Any client can generate one time token (OTT) using existing token. The format for OTT is as follow:

    user_id,timestamp,once,client_id

With `user_id` is the ID of authenticated user; `timestamp` is the unix timestamp for OTT expire time, the OTT will work as long as indicated by `timestamp` or by token expire date, whatever comes first; `client_id` is the client ID; `once` is md5 of a concentration of `user_id`, `timestamp`, a valid existing token and the client secret. Example code to generate an OTT:

    <?php

    $timestamp = time() + $ttl;
    $once = md5($userId . $timestamp . $accessToken . $clientSecret);

    $ott = sprintf('%d,%d,%s,%s', $userId, $timestamp, $once, $clientId);

### Configuration
 * TTL of access token: 1 hour
 * TTL of authorization code: 30 seconds
 * TTL of refresh token: 2 weeks
 * Authorization URI: `/oauth/authorize`
 * Access token exchange URI: `/oauth/token`

### Discoverability
System information and availability can be determined by sending a GET request to `/` (index route). A list of resources will be returned. If the request is authenticated, the revisions of API system and installed modules will also made available for further inspection.

## Common Parameters

### Fields filtering
For API method with resource data like a forum or a thread, the data can be filtered to get interested fields only. When there are no filter 

 * `fields_include`: coma-separated list of fields of a resource. If this parameter is used along with `fields_exclude`, the other parameter will be ignored.
 * `fields_exclude`: coma-separated list of fields of a resource to exclude in the response. Cannot be used with `fields_include` or this parameter will be ignored.

### Resource ordering
For API method with list of resources, the resources can be ordered differently with the parameter `order`. List of supported orders will be specified for each method. The default order will always be `natural`. Most of the time, the natural order is the order of which each resource is added to the system (resource id for example).

### Encryption
For sensitive information like password, encryption can be used to increase data security. For all encryption with key support, the `client_secret` will be used as the key. List of supported encryptions:

 * `aes128`: AES 128 bit encryption (mode: ECB, padding: PKCS#7). Because of algorithm limitation, the binary md5 hash of key will be used instead of the key itself.
